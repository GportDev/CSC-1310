# Data-structures
### A data structure is a way to organize data so that it can be used effectively

They can be really important when you are dealing with a huge amount of data.

<br>

## Arrays

Linear data structure that contains a ordered list of items

<br>

## Lists

Linear data structures which elements form a sequence, each element is called node, and each node contains data and <ins>at least one link<ins>.

Doubly-linked list have links for both sides (forwards and backwards), singly-linked list have links just forwards

<br>

## Trees

Linear data structure with many types:
- Binary trees
- Binary search trees
- B-Trees
- Heaps
- Treaps
- AVL trees
- Red-black trees
- more...

<br>

### Binary trees

Each node must have zero, one or two children (Never more than that)

<br>

## Hash tables

Uses a hash function and an array to store unordered data. The hash function is used to map the data item to an element (bucket) in the array

<br>

## Graphs

This one represents connections among items, a __vertex__ representes an item in a graph and an edge represents a connection between two vertices
- Undirected - The edges can go back and forwards to vertex
- Directed - Edges can't go back and forwards, just one direction

<br>
<br>

# Algorithms

A sequence of clear steps to solve a problem

<br>

## Efficiency
The goal of the CS is to find the fastest way to solve a problem that uses the least amount of space

- Space efficiency
- Time efficiency

## Data types

The type of data and operations you can do with this data

- Primitive -> Int, float, char
- Abstract -> Queues, lists, maps, vehicles

Abstraction means the process of describing things using only the importa details
